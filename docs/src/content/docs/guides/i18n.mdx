description: Learn how internationalization works with the Starlight Videos plugin
---

Starlight Videos relies on Starlight's built-in support for [internationalization](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) to provide multilingual support for page including videos with features like routing or fallback content.

See the [Starlight internationalization documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/) for more information on how to configure i18n in your Starlight website.

## Fallback content

Similar to Starlight, Starlight Videos expects you to create equivalent pages for your videos in all your languages.
For example, if you have an `en/videos/getting-started.md` file, create an `getting-started.md` for each other language you support.
This allows Starlight and the Starlight Videos plugin to provide automatic fallback content for pages with videos that have not yet been translated.

Read more about fallback content in the Starlight [“Internationalization”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#fallback-content) guide.

## Translate the UI

The Starlight Videos plugin allows you to translate the default UI strings used by the plugin so that your pages with videos can be fully localized and readers can enjoy a seamless experience in their preferred language.

import LanguagesList from '../../../components/LanguagesList.astro'
import TranslationsList from '../../../components/TranslationsList.astro'

<LanguagesList startsSentence /> translated UI strings are provided out of the box.

To provide translations for additional languages you support — or override the default ones — check the [“Translate Starlight’s UI”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#translate-starlights-ui) guide in the Starlight documentation.

These are the English defaults of the existing strings Starlight Videos ships with:
