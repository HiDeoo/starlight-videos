---

A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to quickly and easily enhance your documentation with video guides and courses.

- Easily tranform any documentation page into a video guide or course
- Support for individual videos or collections of videos
- Quickly list all videos or video collections in dedicated pages
- Enhance your videos with interactive lists, quizzes, transcripts, and more

:::tip[Head's up!]
Starlight Videos is at an early stage of development.
Some limitations apply, and only YouTube videos are supported at the moment and some planned features like progress tracking, or collection chapters are not yet available.
:::

Check out the [demo guides](/demo/video-guides/) and [demo courses](/demo/video-courses/) pages for a preview of the plugin.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'

<Steps>

1. Starlight Videos is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-videos" />
   <br />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4,9}
   // @ts-check
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   import starlightVideos from 'starlight-videos'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         plugins: [starlightVideos()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Starlight Videos uses Astroâ€™s [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/), which are configured in the `src/content.config.ts` file.

   Update the content config file to add support for customizing documentation pages with videos using their frontmatter:

   ```js title="src/content.config.ts" ins={4} ins="{ extend: videosSchema }"
   import { docsLoader } from '@astrojs/starlight/loaders'
   import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema'
   import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'
   import { videosSchema } from 'starlight-videos/schemas'

   export const collections = {
     docs: defineCollection({
       loader: docsLoader(),
       schema: docsSchema({ extend: videosSchema }),
     }),
   }
   ```

4. Create your first page containing a video by creating a new `.md` or `.mdx` file defining a `video` in the frontmatter:

   ```md title="src/content/docs/videos/getting-started.md" {3-6}
   ---
   title: My first video
   video:
     type: video
     link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u0Ds7wzUeI
     duration: 180
   ---

   ## My first video

   Welcome to my first video guide!
   ```

5. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview your first video guide.

</Steps>

The Starlight Videos plugin supports different types of content from a basic [video](/content/video/) like a guide to a more complex [collection](/content/collection/) of videos like a course.
