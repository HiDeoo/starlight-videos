Hi! We're excited to share Starlight today —
a documentation theme and website builder  

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,834
from the team at Astro.

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,717
It takes time to make a high 
performance, accessible website 

4
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:13,617
that your users find easy to navigate,  
but Starlight aims to make that easy for you.

5
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:16,434
Bring your content in 
Markdown, MDX or Markdoc format 

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,417
and we'll make it possible 
to get started in minutes. 

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,567
Let's take a look at what's included.

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,050
We've got color theming — dark and light mode —   

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,500
full internationalization support —
change languages and see the UI change with it, 

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,517
so just bring your multilingual content, 
Starlight takes care of the rest.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,900
Site search is crucial for 
a documentation website: 

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,350
users need to be able to find 
what they're looking for. 

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,517
With Starlight, it's built in.

14
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:46,317
Deploy your site, search for what 
you're looking for, and find it.

15
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:50,567
Built-in components as well as bringing your 
own components is all supported.

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,317
Use components from React, Preact, 
Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, and Alpine. 

17
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:58,250
Thanks to being built on Astro, 
Starlight supports all of this.

18
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,734
If you need to customize the theme, 

19
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:04,200
we have a color theme editor 
to help you get started. 

20
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:10,550
Try some random values for inspiration,
pick one of our built-in themes, 

21
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,800
or adjust to match your brand colors.
When you're ready, 

22
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:17,100
copy some code into your 
project and you're good to go.

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,267
We're really excited to share Starlight with you.  

24
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,850
We’ve worked hard to make 
this a high performance,   

25
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,450
accessible solution for your docs,
so whether you need small site for  

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,917
your next weekend project
or are documenting a  

27
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,667
mature product for your customers,
we hope you give Starlight a try.
